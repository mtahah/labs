## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Pod Stuck in Pending State
**Symptoms:** Pod shows status as "Pending"

**Diagnosis Commands:**
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
kubectl top nodes
```

**Common Causes:**
- Insufficient cluster resources (CPU/Memory)
- Image pull issues
- Persistent Volume availability
- Node selector constraints

**Solution Steps:**
1. Check resource requests vs available resources
2. Verify image name and accessibility
3. Review node conditions and taints

#### Issue 2: Cannot Connect to Service
**Symptoms:** Connection timeouts or refused connections

**Diagnosis Commands:**
```bash
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
kubectl describe service <service-name>
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```

**Common Causes:**
- Service selector doesn't match pod labels
- Wrong port configuration
- Pod not in ready state
- Network policy blocking traffic

**Solution Steps:**
1. Verify service selector matches pod labels exactly
2. Confirm port mappings (port vs targetPort)
3. Check pod readiness probes

#### Issue 3: Image Pull Errors
**Symptoms:** Pod shows "ImagePullBackOff" or "ErrImagePull"

**Diagnosis Commands:**
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get events
```

**Common Causes:**
- Incorrect image name or tag
- Network connectivity issues
- Private registry authentication
- Rate limiting from Docker Hub

**Solution Steps:**
1. Verify image name and tag exist
2. Check registry accessibility
3. Configure image pull secrets if needed
4. Use alternative registries if rate limited

#### Issue 4: DNS Resolution Problems
**Symptoms:** Cannot resolve service names

**Diagnosis Commands:**
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- nslookup kubernetes.default
kubectl describe service kube-dns -n kube-system
```

**Common Causes:**
- CoreDNS pods not running
- Network policy blocking DNS traffic
- Incorrect service name usage

**Solution Steps:**
1. Ensure CoreDNS pods are running
2. Test with FQDN format
3. Check network policies
