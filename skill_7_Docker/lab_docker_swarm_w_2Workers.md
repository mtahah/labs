## Task 1: Initialize a Docker Swarm Cluster

### 🎯 Learning Focus: Understanding Docker Swarm Architecture

**Key Concept**: Docker Swarm transforms individual Docker hosts into a cluster that can be managed as a single virtual system. The Swarm consists of:
- **Manager nodes**: Control the cluster, maintain cluster state, and schedule services
- **Worker nodes**: Execute the containers/tasks assigned by managers

### Subtask 1.1: Connect to the Manager Node

Access your manager machine through the provided terminal.

**💡 Learning Tip**: Always verify your environment before starting. This helps identify potential issues early.

```bash
# Verify Docker installation and version
docker --version
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b
```

```bash
# Check Docker system information and current state
docker info
```

**Key Output Sections to Notice**:
```
Server:
 Context:    default
 Debug Mode: false
 ...
 Swarm: inactive    # ← This shows Swarm is not yet enabled
 ...
```

**🎯 Learning Check**: Let's specifically check Swarm status:
```bash
docker info | grep Swarm
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Swarm: inactive
```

**📚 Why This Matters**: The `inactive` status confirms we're starting with a standalone Docker installation. Once we initialize Swarm, this will change to `active`.

### Subtask 1.2: Initialize the Swarm Cluster

**Key Concept**: The `docker swarm init` command transforms your Docker host into a Swarm manager node and creates a new cluster.

**💡 Learning Tip**: The `--advertise-addr` flag is crucial - it tells other nodes which IP address to use when connecting to this manager.

```bash
# Initialize Docker Swarm with automatic IP detection
echo "🚀 Initializing Docker Swarm cluster..."
docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Swarm initialized: current node (dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex-dq3n5j4lg0o8b5538oigjl4jd 192.168.1.100:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

**🔑 Important**: Save this join command! You'll need it in the next task.

**📚 Understanding the Output**:
- **Node ID**: `dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz` - Unique identifier for this manager node
- **Join Token**: `SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex-dq3n5j4lg0o8b5538oigjl4jd` - Security token for workers
- **Manager Address**: `192.168.1.100:2377` - Where workers connect (port 2377 is Swarm's management port)

### Subtask 1.3: Verify Swarm Initialization

**Learning Focus**: Verification is a critical DevOps practice. Always confirm your changes took effect.

```bash
# Check if Swarm mode is now active
echo "🔍 Checking Swarm status..."
docker info | grep Swarm
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Swarm: active
```

**💡 Success Indicator**: The status changed from `inactive` to `active`!

```bash
# List all nodes in the Swarm cluster
echo "📋 Listing cluster nodes..."
docker node ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID                            HOSTNAME   STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz *   manager    Ready     Active         Leader           24.0.7
```

**📚 Understanding Node Status**:
- **ID**: Unique node identifier
- **HOSTNAME**: Node's hostname (manager)
- **STATUS**: `Ready` means the node is operational
- **AVAILABILITY**: `Active` means it can receive tasks
- **MANAGER STATUS**: `Leader` indicates this is the primary manager
- **ENGINE VERSION**: Docker version on this node
- **Asterisk (*)**: Indicates the current node you're connected to

---

## Task 2: Add Additional Nodes to the Cluster

### 🎯 Learning Focus: Understanding Swarm Security and Node Roles

**Key Concept**: Swarm uses cryptographic tokens for security. Worker and manager tokens are different to maintain the principle of least privilege.

### Subtask 2.1: Retrieve Join Tokens

**💡 Learning Tip**: Tokens can be regenerated if compromised using `docker swarm join-token --rotate worker`.

```bash
# Get the worker join token (run on manager node)
echo "🔑 Retrieving worker join token..."
docker swarm join-token worker
```

**Expected Output**:
```
To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex-dq3n5j4lg0o8b5538oigjl4jd 192.168.1.100:2377
```

**🔒 Security Note**: This token grants worker-level access only. For manager tokens, use `docker swarm join-token manager`.

### Subtask 2.2: Join Worker Node 1

Connect to your **worker1** machine.

```bash
# Verify Docker is running on worker1
echo "✅ Verifying Docker installation on worker1..."
docker --version
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b
```

```bash
# Join the Swarm cluster as a worker
echo "🤝 Joining Swarm cluster as worker1..."
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex-dq3n5j4lg0o8b5538oigjl4jd 192.168.1.100:2377
```
*Replace the token and IP with your actual values from the manager output*

**Expected Output**:
```
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

**📚 What Just Happened**: 
- Worker1 authenticated using the security token
- It registered itself with the manager node
- The manager added it to the cluster database
- Worker1 is now ready to receive and execute tasks

### Subtask 2.3: Join Worker Node 2

Connect to your **worker2** machine.

```bash
# Join worker2 to the Swarm
echo "🤝 Joining Swarm cluster as worker2..."
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-49nj1cmql0jkz5s954yi3oex-dq3n5j4lg0o8b5538oigjl4jd 192.168.1.100:2377
```

**Expected Output**:
```
This node joined a swarm as a worker.
```

### Subtask 2.4: Verify All Nodes Joined

Return to the **manager** node.

```bash
# List all nodes in the cluster
echo "🏗️ Verifying complete cluster topology..."
docker node ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID                            HOSTNAME   STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz *   manager    Ready     Active         Leader           24.0.7
x1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngza     worker1    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
y2zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngzb     worker2    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
```

**🎉 Success Indicators**:
- **3 nodes total**: 1 manager + 2 workers
- **All nodes "Ready"**: Can accept and execute tasks
- **All nodes "Active"**: Available for scheduling
- **Manager shows "Leader"**: Primary decision-maker for the cluster

---

## Task 3: Deploy a Multi-Container Service Using Docker Stack

### 🎯 Learning Focus: Understanding Service Orchestration and Overlay Networks

**Key Concepts**:
- **Docker Stack**: Manages multi-service applications as a single unit
- **Overlay Networks**: Allow containers across different hosts to communicate securely
- **Service Placement**: Control where containers run using constraints

### Subtask 3.1: Create a Docker Compose File

**💡 Learning Tip**: Stacks use the same Compose file format but add orchestration features like replicas, placement constraints, and restart policies.

```bash
# Create project directory
echo "📁 Setting up project structure..."
mkdir ~/swarm-lab
cd ~/swarm-lab
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Current directory: /home/ubuntu/swarm-lab
```

```bash
# Create comprehensive Docker Compose file for the stack
echo "📝 Creating Docker Compose file with orchestration features..."
cat > docker-compose.yml << 'EOF'
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    deploy:
      replicas: 3                    # Run 3 instances for load balancing
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure        # Restart if container fails
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == worker      # Only run on worker nodes
    volumes:
      - web-content:/usr/share/nginx/html
    networks:
      - webnet

  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    deploy:
      replicas: 1                    # Single instance (stateful service)
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    networks:
      - webnet                       # Same network for service communication

  visualizer:
    image: dockersamples/visualizer:stable
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"  # Access Docker API
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - node.role == manager     # Run on manager for Docker socket access
    networks:
      - webnet

volumes:
  web-content:                       # Shared storage across nodes

networks:
  webnet:
    driver: overlay                  # Multi-host networking
EOF

echo "✅ Compose file created successfully!"
```

**📚 Configuration Deep Dive**:

**Web Service**:
- **3 replicas**: Provides load balancing and high availability
- **Worker constraint**: Separates application workload from management
- **Nginx**: Lightweight web server perfect for demonstrations

**Redis Service**:
- **1 replica**: Stateful services typically run single instances
- **No placement constraint**: Can run on any available node

**Visualizer Service**:
- **Manager constraint**: Needs Docker socket access for cluster visualization
- **Port 8080**: Web interface to see real-time cluster state

**Overlay Network**:
- **Cross-host communication**: Containers can talk across different machines
- **Encrypted by default**: Secure communication between services

### Subtask 3.2: Deploy the Stack

**💡 Learning Tip**: Stack deployment is atomic - either all services deploy successfully, or none do.

```bash
# Deploy the complete application stack
echo "🚀 Deploying multi-service application stack..."
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml webapp
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Creating network webapp_webnet
Creating service webapp_web
Creating service webapp_redis
Creating service webapp_visualizer
```

**📚 What's Happening**:
1. **Network Creation**: Overlay network `webapp_webnet` spans all nodes
2. **Service Creation**: Each service gets registered in the cluster
3. **Task Scheduling**: Manager decides which nodes run which containers
4. **Container Starting**: Docker pulls images and starts containers on assigned nodes

```bash
# Verify stack deployment
echo "📊 Checking deployed stacks..."
docker stack ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
NAME      SERVICES   ORCHESTRATOR
webapp    3          Swarm
```

```bash
# List services within the stack
echo "🔍 Examining stack services..."
docker stack services webapp
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME                MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                             PORTS
abc123def456   webapp_redis        replicated   1/1        redis:alpine                      
def456ghi789   webapp_visualizer   replicated   1/1        dockersamples/visualizer:stable   *:8080->8080/tcp
ghi789jkl012   webapp_web          replicated   3/3        nginx:alpine                      *:80->80/tcp
```

**📊 Understanding Service Status**:
- **REPLICAS**: Shows desired vs actual running containers (3/3 means all 3 are running)
- **MODE**: `replicated` means multiple instances, `global` would mean one per node
- **PORTS**: `*:80->80/tcp` means accessible on port 80 from any node

### Subtask 3.3: Verify Service Deployment

```bash
# Get detailed status of all services
echo "🔍 Detailed service inspection..."
docker service ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME                MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                             PORTS
abc123def456   webapp_redis        replicated   1/1        redis:alpine                      
def456ghi789   webapp_visualizer   replicated   1/1        dockersamples/visualizer:stable   *:8080->8080/tcp
ghi789jkl012   webapp_web          replicated   3/3        nginx:alpine                      *:80->80/tcp
```

```bash
# See which nodes are running web service containers
echo "🗺️  Web service distribution across nodes..."
docker service ps webapp_web
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME           IMAGE          NODE      DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE           ERROR     PORTS
mno345pqr678   webapp_web.1   nginx:alpine   worker1   Running         Running 2 minutes ago             
pqr678stu901   webapp_web.2   nginx:alpine   worker2   Running         Running 2 minutes ago             
stu901vwx234   webapp_web.3   nginx:alpine   worker1   Running         Running 2 minutes ago             
```

**📊 Distribution Analysis**:
- Notice how containers are distributed across worker nodes
- Swarm's scheduler automatically balances the load
- If a node fails, containers will be rescheduled to healthy nodes

```bash
# Check all service distributions
echo "🌐 Complete service topology..."
docker service ps webapp_web webapp_redis webapp_visualizer
```

## Task 4: Scale Services Within the Swarm

### 🎯 Learning Focus: Dynamic Scaling and Load Distribution

**Key Concept**: Scaling is one of orchestration's biggest advantages. You can adjust capacity without downtime or manual container management.

### Subtask 4.1: Scale the Web Service

```bash
# Check current service scale
echo "📊 Current service scaling status..."
docker service ls
```

**💡 Observation**: Note the REPLICAS column showing current scale.

```bash
# Scale web service to handle more traffic
echo "📈 Scaling web service from 3 to 5 replicas..."
docker service scale webapp_web=5
```

**Expected Output**:
```
webapp_web scaled to 5
overall progress: 5 out of 5 tasks 
1/5: running   [==================================================>] 
2/5: running   [==================================================>] 
3/5: running   [==================================================>] 
4/5: running   [==================================================>] 
5/5: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged
```

**📚 Scaling Process**:
1. **Command Received**: Manager processes the scale request
2. **Task Creation**: 2 new tasks created (5 desired - 3 current = 2 new)
3. **Scheduling**: Manager assigns new tasks to available nodes
4. **Container Creation**: New containers start on assigned nodes
5. **Load Balancer Update**: Traffic automatically distributes to all 5 instances

```bash
# Monitor the scaling process in real-time
echo "⏱️  Monitoring scaling progress..."
docker service ps webapp_web
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME           IMAGE          NODE      DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE            ERROR     PORTS

```

```bash
# Verify new replica count
echo "✅ Verifying scale operation success..."
docker service ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME                MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                             PORTS

```

### Subtask 4.2: Scale Multiple Services

**💡 Learning Tip**: You can scale multiple services simultaneously, which is useful during traffic spikes or maintenance windows.

```bash
# Scale multiple services in one command
echo "🔄 Scaling multiple services simultaneously..."
docker service scale webapp_web=2 webapp_redis=2
```

**Expected Output**:
```
webapp_web scaled to 2
webapp_redis scaled to 2
overall progress: 2 out of 2 tasks 
1/2: running   [==================================================>] 
2/2: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged 

overall progress: 2 out of 2 tasks 
1/2: running   [==================================================>] 
2/2: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged
```

```bash
# Check updated service status
echo "📊 Updated service scaling status..."
docker service ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME                MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                             PORTS
abc123def456   webapp_redis        replicated   2/2        redis:alpine                      
def456ghi789   webapp_visualizer   replicated   1/1        dockersamples/visualizer:stable   *:8080->8080/tcp
ghi789jkl012   webapp_web          replicated   2/2        nginx:alpine                      *:80->80/tcp
```

```bash
# See updated distribution
echo "🗺️  Updated service distribution..."
docker service ps webapp_web webapp_redis
```

### Subtask 4.3: Test Service High Availability

**🎯 Learning Focus**: Understanding Swarm's Self-Healing Capabilities

**Key Concept**: Swarm continuously monitors container health and automatically reschedules failed containers to maintain desired state.

```bash
# First, identify which containers are running where
echo "🔍 Current service distribution before failure simulation..."
docker service ps webapp_web
```

**📋 Note**: Record which worker node has running containers.

```bash
# Check current node status
echo "🏥 Cluster health status..."
docker node ls
```

Now, connect to **worker1** or **worker2** (whichever has running containers):

```bash
# Simulate node failure by stopping Docker service
echo "⚠️  Simulating node failure by stopping Docker..."
sudo systemctl stop docker
echo "Docker service stopped on this node"
```

Return to the **manager** node:

```bash
# Observe Swarm's automatic recovery response
echo "🚨 Monitoring Swarm's response to node failure..."
docker service ps webapp_web
```

**Expected Output** (after a few moments):
```
ID             NAME           IMAGE          NODE      DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE            ERROR     PORTS
abc123def456   webapp_web.1   nginx:alpine   worker2   Running         Running 1 minute ago               
def456ghi789   webapp_web.2   nginx:alpine   worker2   Running         Running 30 seconds ago             
xyz789old111   webapp_web.1   nginx:alpine   worker1   Shutdown        Failed 45 seconds ago    "task: non-zero exit (125)"
```

**📚 What You're Seeing**:
- **New containers**: Started on healthy nodes to maintain desired state
- **Failed containers**: Marked as "Shutdown" with failure reason
- **Automatic rescheduling**: No manual intervention required

```bash
# Check node status during failure
echo "🏥 Node status during failure..."
docker node ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID                            HOSTNAME   STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz *   manager    Ready     Active         Leader           24.0.7
x1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngza     worker1    Down      Active                          24.0.7
y2zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngzb     worker2    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
```

**🔍 Notice**: worker1 shows "Down" status but remains "Active" (will rejoin when healthy).

Now, return to the affected worker node:

```bash
# Restore the "failed" node
echo "🔧 Restoring failed node..."
sudo systemctl start docker
echo "Docker service restarted"
```

Return to the **manager** node:

```bash
# Verify node recovery
echo "💚 Verifying node recovery..."
docker node ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID                            HOSTNAME   STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz *   manager    Ready     Active         Leader           24.0.7
x1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngza     worker1    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
y2zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngzb     worker2    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
```

**🎉 Recovery Complete**: All nodes show "Ready" status again.

---

## Task 5: Inspect the State of Services and Nodes

### 🎯 Learning Focus: Monitoring and Troubleshooting Production Clusters

**Key Concept**: Effective operations require comprehensive visibility into cluster state, service health, and resource utilization.

### Subtask 5.1: Comprehensive Service Inspection

```bash
# Get overview of all services across all stacks
echo "📊 Complete service inventory..."
docker service ls
```

```bash
# Deep dive into web service configuration
echo "🔍 Detailed web service inspection..."
docker service inspect webapp_web
```

**💡 Learning Tip**: This JSON output contains everything about the service - networking, placement, resources, update config, etc.

```bash
# Get a human-readable format
echo "📖 Human-readable service configuration..."
docker service inspect --pretty webapp_web
```

**Expected Output** (excerpt):

```

### Subtask 5.3: Network and Volume Inspection

**💡 Learning Tip**: Understanding Swarm networking is crucial for troubleshooting connectivity issues.

```bash
# List all networks (including overlay networks)
echo "🌐 Complete network inventory..."
docker network ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
NETWORK ID     NAME              DRIVER    SCOPE
abc123def456   bridge            bridge    local
def456ghi789   docker_gwbridge   bridge    local
ghi789jkl012   host              host      local
jkl012mno345   none              null      local
mno345pqr678   webapp_webnet     overlay   swarm
```

**📚 Network Types**:
- **bridge**: Default single-host networking
- **overlay**: Multi-host Swarm networking (notice `swarm` scope)
- **host**: Direct host networking
- **docker_gwbridge**: Gateway between overlay and host networks

```bash
# Inspect the overlay network
echo "🔍 Overlay network detailed inspection..."
docker network inspect webapp_webnet
```

**Key Information to Notice**:
- **Scope**: `swarm` - spans multiple nodes
- **Driver**: `overlay` - multi-host networking
- **Subnet**: Automatically assigned IP range
- **Containers**: Shows which containers are connected

```bash
# List volumes created by the stack
echo "💾 Volume inventory..."
docker volume ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     webapp_web-content
```

```bash
# Inspect volume details
echo "🔍 Volume detailed inspection..."
docker volume inspect webapp_web-content
```

### Subtask 5.4: Access the Deployed Application

**🎯 Learning Focus**: Testing Load Balancing and Service Discovery

```bash
# Get manager node IP for access
echo "🌐 Finding cluster access points..."
MANAGER_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
echo "Manager IP: $MANAGER_IP"
echo "Main application URL: http://$MANAGER_IP"
echo "Visualizer URL: http://$MANAGER_IP:8080"
```

```bash
# Test load balancing with multiple requests
echo "🔄 Testing load balancing..."
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Request $i:"
  curl -s http://$MANAGER_IP | grep -o '<title>.*</title>' || echo "Response received"
  sleep 1
done
```

**💡 Load Balancing Test**: Each request might hit a different container. Swarm's built-in load balancer (routing mesh) distributes traffic across all replicas.

```bash
# Check which containers are actually serving requests
echo "📊 Current service distribution handling requests..."
docker service ps webapp_web
```

---

## Advanced Operations

### Rolling Updates

**🎯 Learning Focus**: Zero-Downtime Deployments

**Key Concept**: Rolling updates replace containers one at a time, ensuring service availability during updates.

```bash
# Perform a rolling update to latest nginx image
echo "🔄 Initiating rolling update..."
docker service update --image nginx:latest webapp_web
```

**Expected Output**:
```
webapp_web
overall progress: 2 out of 2 tasks 
1/2: running   [==================================================>] 
2/2: running   [==================================================>] 
verify: Service converged
```

```bash
# Monitor rolling update progress
echo "📊 Rolling update progress..."
docker service ps webapp_web
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME               IMAGE          NODE      DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE                ERROR     PORTS
new123abc456   webapp_web.1       nginx:latest   worker1   Running         Running 30 seconds ago               
new456def789   webapp_web.2       nginx:latest   worker2   Running         Running 45 seconds ago               
old789ghi012   webapp_web.1       nginx:alpine   worker1   Shutdown        Shutdown 1 minute ago               
old012jkl345   webapp_web.2       nginx:alpine   worker2   Shutdown        Shutdown 1 minute ago               
```

**📚 Rolling Update Process**:
1. **One-by-one replacement**: Old containers shut down as new ones start
2. **Health checks**: New containers must be healthy before old ones stop
3. **Zero downtime**: Service remains available throughout the process
4. **Rollback capability**: Previous version info retained for potential rollback

### Node Maintenance - Draining Nodes

**🎯 Learning Focus**: Planned Maintenance Without Service Interruption

**Key Concept**: Draining removes all running tasks from a node gracefully, allowing for maintenance while keeping services available.

```bash
# Drain worker1 for maintenance
echo "🔧 Draining worker1 for maintenance..."
docker node update --availability drain worker1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
worker1
```

```bash
# Observe how services redistribute
echo "🔄 Monitoring service redistribution during drain..."
docker service ps webapp_web
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID             NAME               IMAGE          NODE      DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE            ERROR     PORTS
redistributed1 webapp_web.1       nginx:latest   worker2   Running         Running 30 seconds ago             
redistributed2 webapp_web.2       nginx:latest   worker2   Running         Running 45 seconds ago             
drained001     webapp_web.1       nginx:latest   worker1   Shutdown        Shutdown 1 minute ago              
drained002     webapp_web.2       nginx:latest   worker1   Shutdown        Shutdown 1 minute ago              
```

```bash
# Check node status during drain
echo "🏥 Node status during maintenance..."
docker node ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID                            HOSTNAME   STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz *   manager    Ready     Active         Leader           24.0.7
x1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngza     worker1    Ready     Drain                           24.0.7
y2zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngzb     worker2    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
```

**📚 Drain Status Explanation**:
- **STATUS**: `Ready` - Node is healthy but not accepting new tasks
- **AVAILABILITY**: `Drain` - All existing tasks moved elsewhere
- **No service interruption**: Applications continue running on other nodes

```bash
# Return node to active status after maintenance
echo "✅ Returning worker1 to active status..."
docker node update --availability active worker1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
worker1
```

```bash
# Verify node is back in service
echo "🔄 Verifying node restoration..."
docker node ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID                            HOSTNAME   STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
dxn1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngz *   manager    Ready     Active         Leader           24.0.7
x1zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngza     worker1    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
y2zf6l61qsb1josjja83ngzb     worker2    Ready     Active                          24.0.7
```

**💡 Note**: Existing tasks won't automatically redistribute back to worker1 unless you scale or restart services.

## Cleanup and Best Practices

### Remove the Stack

**🎯 Learning Focus**: Proper Resource Management

```bash
# Remove the deployed stack
echo "🧹 Removing application stack..."
docker stack rm webapp
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Removing service webapp_redis
Removing service webapp_visualizer
Removing service webapp_web
Removing network webapp_webnet
```

**📚 Cleanup Process**:
1. **Services stopped**: All containers gracefully shut down
2. **Networks removed**: Overlay network deleted
3. **Volumes preserved**: Data volumes remain for potential reuse (manual cleanup needed)

```bash
# Verify complete stack removal
echo "✅ Verifying stack removal..."
docker stack ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
NAME      SERVICES   ORCHESTRATOR
```

```bash
# Confirm no services remain
echo "✅ Confirming service cleanup..."
docker service ls
```

**Expected Output**:
```
ID        NAME      MODE      REPLICAS   IMAGE     PORTS
```

```bash
# Check for remaining volumes (cleanup if needed)
echo "🔍 Checking for remaining volumes..."
docker volume ls
```

```bash
# Remove leftover volumes if desired
echo "🗑️  Cleaning up volumes..."
docker volume prune -f
```

### Leave the Swarm (Optional)

**⚠️ Warning**: Only perform this if you want to completely dismantle the cluster.

```bash
# On worker nodes, leave the Swarm
echo "👋 Worker nodes leaving Swarm..."
```

On **worker1** and **worker2**:
```bash
docker swarm leave
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Node left the swarm.
```

Back on the **manager** node:
```bash
# Remove disconnected worker nodes
echo "🗑️  Removing disconnected nodes..."
docker node rm worker1 worker2
```

```bash
# Manager leaves Swarm mode (destroys cluster)
echo "🏁 Manager leaving Swarm - cluster destruction..."
docker swarm leave --force
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Node left the swarm.
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Node Fails to Join Swarm
**Symptoms**:
```
Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error
```

**💡 Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check network connectivity between nodes
ping MANAGER_IP

# Verify required ports are open
nc -zv MANAGER_IP 2377  # Management
nc -zv MANAGER_IP 7946  # Node communication  
nc -zv MANAGER_IP 4789  # Overlay network
```

**🔧 Solutions**:
- Ensure firewall allows ports 2377, 7946, and 4789
- Check if manager IP is reachable from worker
- Verify token hasn't expired (regenerate if needed)

#### Issue 2: Services Not Starting
**Symptoms**:
```bash
docker service ls
# Shows 0/3 replicas running
```

**💡 Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check service logs for errors
docker service logs SERVICE_NAME

# Inspect failed tasks
docker service ps SERVICE_NAME --no-trunc

# Verify image availability
docker service inspect SERVICE_NAME --pretty
```

**🔧 Common Solutions**:
- Image pull failures: Check image name/tag
- Resource constraints: Insufficient memory/CPU
- Placement constraints: No nodes match requirements

#### Issue 3: Cannot Access Deployed Application
**Symptoms**: 
- Connection timeouts when accessing application URLs

**💡 Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Verify services are running
docker service ls

# Check port mappings
docker service inspect --pretty webapp_web

# Test from manager node
curl localhost:80
```

**🔧 Solutions**:
- Verify port mappings in compose file
- Check if services are running on expected nodes
- Ensure firewall allows external access to published ports

#### Issue 4: Swarm Initialization Fails
**Symptoms**:
```
Error response from daemon: could not choose an IP address to advertise
```

**💡 Solution**:
```bash
# Specify advertise address explicitly
docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(ip route get 1 | awk '{print $7; exit}')
```

### Essential Debugging Commands

```bash
# System-wide Docker information
docker system info

# Real-time events monitoring
docker system events --since 1h

# Node connectivity test
docker node inspect NODE_NAME --format '{{.Status.Addr}}'

# Service task distribution
docker service ps SERVICE_NAME --format 'table {{.Name}}\t{{.Node}}\t{{.CurrentState}}'

# Network connectivity within overlay
docker exec CONTAINER_ID ping SERVICE_NAME

# Resource usage monitoring
